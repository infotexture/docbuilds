# The Rules

Everybody is welcome to contribute to DocBuilds, just fork the [Github repo](https://github.com/plaindocs/docbuilds) and send a pull request.
Each static documentation generator is a markdown file in the `source/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new static documentation generators if they follow the following rules:

*   **Static Documentation Generation:** The focus is on documentation, not on static site generators. Those are already covered by [StaticGen](http://www.staticgen.com).
*   **Open Source:** The generator must be released under an open source license.
*   **Accessible on GitHub:** The generator must have a public repository on Github that we can link to and pull in stats from.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static documentation generators in `source/projects`.

Many static documentation generators support different template engines. Don't list them all in the template field, just the one(s) used by default. Feel free to go into more details in the body text.
