# About DocBuilds

DocBuilds is a leaderboard of open-source documentation generators. It's run by [Plaindocs](http://www.plaindocs.com), creator of quality API documentation. It was partially inspired by a conversation with [@lucapette](https://twitter.com/lucapette).

DocBuilds source-code is available on [Github](http://github.com/plaindocs/docbuilds) and you're more than welcome to contribute as long as you [follow the guidelines](/guidelines.html). DocBuilds is built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and started as a clone of [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com).

## About StaticGen
